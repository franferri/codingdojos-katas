## Coding Dojo - Proposal

### What’s this Coding Dojo/Kata all about?
Is a Software Crafters session, meaning we respect each other, show passion for learning and teaching!

A Coding Dojo is an event where we just sit together and develop for an hour one well defined problem.
During the time that the exercise lasts you seek for a solution of the problem, you compare yours with other people and you share your blockers or strategies.

### What we want to do
I would like to organize a Coding Dojo in [YOUR COMPANY OFFICE HERE], every X weeks for a group of aprox X people.

The Coding Dojo will be driven by [VOLUNTEER] and will consist in a Kata’s exercise, different everytime. 

Example past events:

* The exercise will be executed by groups of 2 persons
* Each group will be using only 1 computer.
* Each group will be choosing their preferred language (Java, C#, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C++…).
* The 2 persons groups may be randomly shuffled between all persons to maximize the knowledge sharing.
* All we need to do this is a room able to allow X persons comfortably, and a big-screen/projector that let us show the exercise description in the screen while is being done, and post demo to discuss the different results.
* The aim is to develop the proposed exercise using TDD (Red Green Refactor).
* The pace of the event is distributed, depending of the amount of people but in general 3 splits of 25 mins each and 5 mins gap for sharing blockers and experiences.
* One rule is to keep changing the navigator, who touches the keyboard of the couple after each split.
* The only technical skill needed is to be able to write and run a simple test.
* Is designed to let juniors and seniors share the experience collaborating in the same problem.
* The kata exercise is shared in advance.

And the final goal is to practice design patterns and share different paradigms. Actually, there is no aim of finishing the kata.

The ideal scope of the event has to be [YOUR COMPANY OR DEPARTMENT HERE]] wide, it will be more enriching experience since the sharing will happen between unknown partners, people that don't work together in the daily basis.

Of course, none of the code, technology or information will be related with [YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE] toolset or code.

Starting date, immediately after the company accpets and the rooms have availability.

Perfect time to do this: Afternoons starting at 16 or 17, to let people join.

We would like to start doing this Kata http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata followed by http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/ and so on.

Extra mile: Some casual pizza may help to learn and focus.
